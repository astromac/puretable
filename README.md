# puretable
PureTable is a way to display tabular data on small screens with a readable, friendly user experience. This includes ARIA and WCAG 2.0 compliance.

It is written in plain, modern JavaScript (ECMAScript 2016 and newer) and strives to include only the barest amount of third-party dependencies.
